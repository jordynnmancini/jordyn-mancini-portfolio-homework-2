# Jordyn Mancini - Homework 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My-Task

Using the skills I have learned in this course so far, I have created a Web-based Portofolio to showcase who I am and my work samples. It is designed as a template that can be added to in the future as I have more work to showcase. This will be crucial in my career as a web development professional. 


## Deployed-Project 

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

And the web application can be found here:

## The-Process

I used HTML & CSS to build this website, using the tricks and skills we have learned over the past few weeks. I've inserted media querys and flexbox properties to ensure this site can be accessed & readable on different applications. 

However, there are some troubles I haven't been able to solve. The subtitle texts over the image links in the Work Section do not shrink at the same rate as the image, and therefore on smaller screens the view looks off.
